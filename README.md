# CIS 1068 - Hiring Recommender (Hiring Filter)

## Project Description
This program is designed to recommend the top 10 applicants for an entry-level Java programmer position based on a set of job applicant data provided in CSV format. The program processes this data to identify and suggest the most suitable candidates using specific criteria.

## Implementation Details
### Criteria Selection:
The chosen criteria for recommending the top applicants are:
1. **Major:** Focus on CS, CE, CIS, IST for foundational programming skills.
2. **Java Proficiency:** Essential for the role; ensures familiarity with the primary language.
3. **GPA:** Indicator of academic performance; higher GPA suggests consistency and dedication.
4. **Other Languages:** Proficiency in additional programming languages indicating versatility.

### Justification for Criteria:
These criteria were selected for their relevance to the entry-level Java role and are quantifiable metrics for assessing technical qualifications. The combined assessment of major, language proficiency, GPA, and versatility provides a comprehensive evaluation of the applicants.

### Limitations of Automated Hiring:
When automating hiring decisions, we miss out on certain candidate profiles, including:
- **Soft Skills:** Communication, teamwork, and adaptability are not assessed through this process.
- **Non-traditional Backgrounds:** Individuals with self-taught or bootcamp experience might be overlooked.
- **Work Experience/Projects:** Practical experience and personal projects are not considered solely based on this automated process.
- **Risk in Diversity/Inclusion:** Automation may favor certain universities or backgrounds, potentially reducing diversity.
- **Neglecting Adaptability/Learning Potential:** The ability to learn and grow with the company is not measured solely through these criteria.
